# Frontpage using HTML and CSS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/chiroto/pen/rNVPNjb](https://codepen.io/chiroto/pen/rNVPNjb).

I was looking for a template to use on an ebay shop product listing but I couldn't find much. I had to improvise. Ebay lets you use only html and css and even then you have restrictions to make it work.

My code is not so clean because I'm new with coding and it also looks different from part to part because i had to compile it in different times.

Well, here is my frontpage using only html and css
